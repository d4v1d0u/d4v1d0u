# 🛡️Maybe I Can Hack
Hi, I'm pıʌɐᗡ  — I'm *probably* not a hacker, but if you leave your admin panel open, I might just take a peek.
I'm currently diving into the world of **penetration testing**, learning how to break into things legally (and then patch them up like a responsible citizen).

## 🧠 Things I Know (Kinda)

- `nmap -sS` does cool things.
- Burp Suite makes the internet cry.
- SQL Injection? More like SQL *Assassination*.
- `admin:admin` works more than it should.

## ⚔️ Current Status

- Fighting virtual machines on TryHackMe.
- Reading documentation like it's ancient scripture.
- Yelling at Metasploit for not working (again).
