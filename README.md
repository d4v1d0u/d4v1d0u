# Hi, I'm OU DAVID

Welcome to my GitHub!

Iâ€™m an aspiring ** IT Support Administrator ** passionate about helping users and solving real-world tech problems. I'm currently learning and building skills in:

- Windows OS and troubleshooting
- Networking fundamentals (IP, DNS, routers)
- VirtualBox & virtualization
- Basic Linux and command-line tools

This GitHub is where I document my IT learning journey and share hands-on mini projects. My long-term goal is to grow into cybersecurity and system administration roles.
